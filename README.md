# LGU file tools
Convert LGU firmware update package files used by Dacia & Renault MediaNav systems.

## What is LGU?
An LGU file is a firmware update package used by Renault & Dacia MediaNav and R-Link navigation and entertainment systems (which run on Windows CE 6.0).  
The firmware update is usually stored on a USB drive and then installed on the MediaNav.  
[m-a-x-s-e-e-l-i-g/MediaNav-to-Evolution-Upgrade](https://github.com/m-a-x-s-e-e-l-i-g/MediaNav-to-Evolution-Upgrade/) contains a guide on how to upgrade MediaNav, and also contains two LGU files.
